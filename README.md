# Data Science Coursework – Research Proposal  
**ECMM443 / Introduction to Data Science – University of Exeter**

This repository contains my full Data Science Research Proposal project for the module *Introduction to Data Science (ECMM443)*.  
The project investigates the research question:

### **“Does using ChatGPT or AI tools improve student performance at Exeter?”**

It includes written documentation, Python code for data simulation and analysis, figures, survey design, and a reflective review following peer feedback.
